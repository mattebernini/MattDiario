# MattDiario

I'm using a Diario app on my Android smartphone but it ask me to pay to save my pages in the cloud and so I make my own diary app.

## How it's built

It's very easy and light: I build a simple Kivy app to write my diary pages from the smartphone, with a button you can save the page locally and with another button you can syncronize sending all the pages not yet syncronized to your personal server.
The server is made using Flask and it shows the diary pages that you have syncronized with the Kivy app.

## Can I use it?

Yes! You only need to chang the urls to your private server and it's done!
